#### Leadership and Influence:

I can support and encourage my teammates to build software solutions that matche the client requirements. During my third year of B.Tech I got an opportunity to work in a team to build an innovative hands-on project under LEAP(Learn Engineering through Activity Programs) program. 
We developed a robotic arm food feeder that feeds those people who can't eat by using thier own hands. As a teammate I could able to code the arduino programming to control the servo motor rotation and sensors.

#### Networking:

As a full stack developer I can share my project experience and developing tools to others who are interested in these fields.
