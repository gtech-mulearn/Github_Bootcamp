#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I actively participate in the testing and improvement process of open-source software. My experience includes testing custom ROMs, Android FOSS apps, and GCam ports. I contribute by providing detailed feedback, bug reports, and suggestions for improvement, which ultimately aids developers in creating better software.
- Recently Contributed to resolving a Navigator error on Anaconda by reporting an issue (Anaconda Issue #13298) on GitHub.

#### History of Community Engagement:

My passion for technology extends beyond coding. I'm an active member of the following communities:

- "Android Community Malayalam" (recognized as a top contributor for helping others troubleshoot issues with Android and desktop devices).
- Novian Hub (tech entrepreneurship community at my college) - I encourage other students to participate in various tech workshops and meetings.
- Volunteering on an Upcoming Open (website) Project on "Self Learning pathways for Students" developing by "Mallu Programmers".

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- Created an awareness post on "Phishing links & Malware extensions which makes data breaches & data loss by using third party websites or exe file on PC" in native language (Malayalam) for Tech groups in Facebook and Telegram. This post reached almost 3,000 audiences, gained 560+ likes, and was an active discussion among groups for 72 hours.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- I developed a To-Do app using Python Django with traditional front-end technologies, which functions as a CRUD model. This project helped my friends manage their schedules and showcases my understanding of web development principles.

#### Competitive Website Profiles:
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/_mzml13) üî•
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/muzammilibrahim3) üë©‚Äçüíª
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/muzammilibrahimpm) üî¨

#### Career Plan:

My immediate goal is to gain experience and hone my skills through freelance work. This will prepare me to secure a developer position in the IT field.  In the long term, I aspire to become a successful **Tech Entrepreneur**.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

I believe Kerala's youth has immense potential in the tech industry. However, access to the right skills and opportunities has been limited in the past. Fortunately, organizations like KSM IEDC and GTech Mulearn are bridging this gap by supporting the growth and development of young talent.
