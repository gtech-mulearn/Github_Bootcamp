# ARJUN V


### About Me

> I am Arjun V, currently in my final year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) at Nehru College of Engineering and Research Centre, having completed my Diploma in EEE at Government Polytechnic College, Palakkad. My journey in engineering has been enriched with diverse experiences, including specialized training in S7 1200 PLC at Siemens India Pvt Ltd and internships at Motherson Automotive Technology and Engineering, Chennai. I showcased my expertise through projects like Advanced Pump Automation during my diploma and a Universal Fast DC Charger for Two-Wheeler EVs in my B.Tech. I am an active member of IEEE and have furthered my skills in VLSI and Embedded Systems through training at NIELIT Calicut. Dedicated to innovation and professional growth, I am committed to contributing meaningfully to the engineering industry.
