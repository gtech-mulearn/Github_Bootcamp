### About Me

> I've just joined as Computer Science & Engineering student at St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai. I am passionate about blending technical skills with innovative thinking. I am familiar with frontend development using HTML5 and CSS3,  while exploring and building my knowledge in JavaScript. I'm also familiar with python and I also enjoy designing Ui/Ux using the software Figma. I am commited to continuous learning and will guide my fellow mates to success as well.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- Although I do not have extensive formal leadership experience at the college, I strive to embody qualities of a leader through collaboration and support. I believe that effective communication is essential for any leader. I make it a point to listen actively and provide constructive feedback, ensuring that everyone feels valued. I am eager to grow my leadership skills further by participating in workshops and engaging with experienced mentors in the community.

#### Networking:

- I enjoy networking, especially through platforms like LinkedIn, where I have the opportunity to connect with professionals in my field. I try to engage by sharing relevant articles and participating in discussions, which helps me learn from others while also contributing to the conversation.I recognize that I still have much to learn, and I hope to build meaningful connections that can help all of us grow together.

#### Career Plan:

- In the immediate term, I aim to deepen my knowledge of the Kerala Startup Mission. I hope to connect with entrepreneurs and innovators to better understand the challenges they face and explore ways I can contribute. I have joined the Young Innovators Program 7.0 as a Voice Of the Stakeholder member and plan to share ideas there. Longer-term, I aspire to be involved in initiatives that support local startups, such as organizing hackathons or workshops that foster skill development and innovation.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- I believe that the above mentioned Kerala Startup Mission is already doing so much for the future generations. Non-Profit Organizations like mulearn is also providing the students with a great opportunity to step forward in the right path.. By focusing on education, funding, and community collaboration, Kerala can build a vibrant technology startup ecosystem that not only attracts talent but also fosters innovation and growth for years to come.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- While I am still in the early stages of my open-source journey, I have actively sought opportunities to contribute to projects that align with my interests and skills. As a beginner I do understand the important role that Open Source Projects play in the lives of us students. As I continue to grow my skills, I plan to take on more significant contributions to open-source projects and eventually launch my own initiatives that address specific challenges within the tech community.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I have actively engaged with the community in a technical capacity by answering questions and sharing insights on platforms such as Reddit and LinkedIn. Furthermore I offer my help to others who have started learning how to code. I may not be and expert but I've come to the realization that the more I try to share my knowledge the more I tend to remember what I've learned.My goal is to continue engaging with the community, helping others, and learning from their experiences
