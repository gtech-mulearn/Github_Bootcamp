#### Leadership and Influence:

- In my capacity as a leader and influencer, I have actively engaged in mentoring and educational activities within the technology field. One of my significant contributions was mentoring students for TinkHerHack 2.0 at Ahalia School of Technology. This hackathon aimed to inspire and empower young minds, especially women, to pursue careers in technology and innovation. My role involved guiding participants through various challenges, providing technical support, and fostering a collaborative environment to enhance their problem-solving skills.

- Furthermore, I organized and conducted a workshop titled "AI Learning Spaces" at my college during Invento 2023, the annual tech fest. This workshop aimed to introduce students to the fundamentals of artificial intelligence, its applications, and the latest advancements in the field. Through interactive sessions and hands-on activities, participants were able to gain practical knowledge and insights into AI technologies. This event not only enriched their understanding but also sparked their interest in exploring AI further.

#### Networking:

- I excel at building strong professional relationships through effective communication and collaboration. I plan to engage with communities via workshops, mentoring, and active participation in tech events. By sharing knowledge and fostering innovation, I aim to inspire, influence, and lead others in advancing our field.

#### Career Plan:

- In the short term, I plan to contribute as a developer, focusing on creating innovative solutions. Long-term, I aim to be a startup incubator that provides resources, networking opportunities, and funding support. By collaborating with educational institutions and industry leaders, I will help strengthen Kerala's startup ecosystem.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala can excel by leveraging its skilled workforce, fostering innovation through hackathons and tech meetups, and enhancing government support. Establishing more incubators, improving digital infrastructure, and promoting industries-academics collaboration will position Kerala as a technology innovation hub.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- VS Code, GitHub, Google Colab.
