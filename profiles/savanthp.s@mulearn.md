| Aqua Monitoring     | Designed and deployment of an innovative automated monitoring system on a robotic boat, spearheading the integration of sensors and data transmission to the cloud via an ESP32       |
| Robo Boat           | microprocessor.   This initiative enabled real-time tracking of pH, temperature, TDS, and turbidity levels during waterway navigation, facilitating informed environmental            |
|                     | decision-making.                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Smart Agro          | Created a home agriculture solution inspired by Google's concept, integrating advanced sensors to monitor vital factors like temperature, pressure, pH, moisture, and UV light.       |
| Monitoring Unit     | Utilized an ESP32 microprocessor to centralize sensor control and data transmission to the cloud. This streamlined system enables tailored plant nourishment for optimal growth.      |
| (SAM-U )            |                                                                                                                                                                                       |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- Explain how you meet the requirement for being a leader or influencer in your domain. Provide clear examples of your leadership and influencing skills.
- I leverage my technical expertise in embedded systems to lead projects and solve complex problems, while also influencing peers through directing them to open-source supports and platforms. 

#### Networking:

- I have always held a good networking even its for the project, or conducting events , i have take up many roles to lead peers and co team members toward the success of project or event. I have been an chairperson of IEEE SB of my college which proved my networking skills for me.
  
#### Career Plan:

- My immediate goal will be to focus on the field of embedded systems and related, develop my skill and in a long term goal in way future, i really wish to start my own startup up company which will me to develop a lot students to get opportunities and skill. 

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- My thoughts are based on what i have experienced, Kerala's tech eco system has a lot of room for further expansion, when considering other big tech leads like Bangalore, Kerala is still at the bottom of stair.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Most of my contribution are for my own projects and job related

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I have helped to keep a good tech community in my college through technically sessions and events, though never able to help through online platforms.

#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- HackerRank : https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/witchhunter008
