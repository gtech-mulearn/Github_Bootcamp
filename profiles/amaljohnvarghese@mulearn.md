## Portfolio Highlights

### My Projects

| Name                | Description                                                               | 
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IMPLEMENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF TILED GEMM ALGORITHMS ON ARM BASED SOC  |This project focuses on creating, implementing and analyzing Tiled General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) algorithms on ARM-based Systems on Chip (SoCs), aiming to optimize matrix multiplication for scientific and computational tasks. A C program has been developed for the tiled matrix multiplication and implementing the algorithm for various matrix dimensions using Xilinx FPGA (ZYNC 7000 Board). The program logic (PL) will be implemented using hardware description language                                            
| AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHT AND DIPPER   |The prototype was designed to automatically dip the headlight of a vehicle, when it senses an oncoming vehicle and to automatically return to high beam thereafter. The entire working of the dipper is an electronic circuitry arrangement, built using 8051 microcontroller, LDR sensor and Ultrasonic sensor, which senses and switches the headlight according to the conditions required.                                            

#### Leadership and Influence:

I am highly passionate about taking on leadership roles and have consistently dedicated myself to ensuring the optimal utilization of team members' skills and strengths. During my early college years, I served as the class representative, where I successfully navigated and overcame numerous challenges. Additionally, I have been actively involved with the IEEE, serving as the founding chairperson of the Signal Processing Society (SPS). Through these experiences, I have honed my leadership abilities and demonstrated my commitment to fostering collaborative and efficient team dynamics.Beyond these formal roles, I have also participated in various events, always ensuring my presence and meaningful contribution.

#### Networking

I am a person who places a high value on networking and building meaningful connections. I maintain active contacts with students across numerous engineering colleges as well as professional members of IEEE. My involvement in the International Model United Nations (IMUN) has also helped me establish international connections. I firmly believe that humans are inherently social beings, and staying connected is essential for personal and professional growth. Consequently, I prioritize my relationships and dedicate significant effort to nurturing and maintaining them.
