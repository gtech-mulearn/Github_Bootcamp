#### Leadership and Influence:

- I have been a member of college elected student council,i had enough opportunities to lead .

#### Networking:

- As a core member of the students council, I had enough opportunities to interact and connect with various industrialists.

#### Career Plan:

- My short-term professional goal is to land an entry-level job in an industrial setting so I can put the theoretical information I've learned in school to use. In two to three years, as my career develops, I hope to reach mid-senior status. After that, I hope to be in a leadership role, able to guide recent graduates towards a road that is either better or comparable to the one I took.


#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala's tech ecosystem is flourishing, driven by a vibrant blend of innovation, talent, and supportive infrastructure. The state has emerged as a significant tech hub, with numerous startups and established companies thriving in an environment that promotes creativity and entrepreneurship.
