| Gas leakage arrestor and monitoring system  | We employ a gas sensor to keep a check on the concentration of LPG in the surrounding.The user is audibly notified about the leakage by buzzer and a warning
message is sent to the user on Blink IOT mobile application.To reduce risk to human life, a servo motor is used to close the gas regulator
automatically and the relay turns on the exhaust fan to reduce the concentration of gas inside the room.This project is implemented using the NodeMCU module and Arduino IDE.                   |
| Microwave Filters | Designed and simulated Microwave filters ( T Hetrz ranges ) in CST and HFSS simulation software.                                           |            |
