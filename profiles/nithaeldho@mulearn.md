| Smart waste management using IoT  | Developed an innovative IoT-based smart waste management system aimed at enhancing the efficiency of household waste collection and management. This system utilizes sensors to monitor the garbage level in waste bins and sends alert messages to the authorities when the waste reaches a specified threshold. The system comprises smart bins equipped with unique IDs for easy identification, and a website that records and manages waste collection data. This project also supports initiatives like Haritha Karma Sena by facilitating easier and more efficient garbage collection through real-time monitoring and communication.                                             | [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
| AIoT Based smart waste management system | The AIoT-based Smart Waste Management System revolutionizes waste handling by employing sensors to monitor bin levels and weight, triggering alerts when thresholds are met. This innovation facilitates efficient waste collection, with alerts sent to authorities for timely action. The system integrates a mobile app to track collection data, offering features like automatic plastic waste sorting into recyclable and non-recyclable categories, and enabling payment for garbage collection. Each bin is assigned a unique ID for location tracking and management purposes. By combining AI and IoT technologies, this system enhances waste management efficiency, promoting sustainability and cleaner environments.                                              | [Hosted Link 2](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/username/project2)             |
