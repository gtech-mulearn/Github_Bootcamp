| Classification of galaxies using image analalysis  | The project is based on classification of galaxies using image analysis method.According to hubble's classification ,galaxies are classified into spiral,Barred spirals,Elliptical and irregular.The basis of hubble's classification is the shape of galaxy,distribution of stars,appearance of special structures and appearance of central bulge.Using the images provied by SDSS database glaxies are classified following Hubble's classification scheme.SDSS database also classifies galaxies into early and late galaxies based on color cut criteria .The color cut criteria used in SDSS is 2.22.The galaxies with U-R value greater than 2.22 is of early type and those with U-R value lesser than 2.22 is of late type.As the observable part of universe include more of late type galaxies than early type ,we can say spiral galaxies are dominant galaxy type in observable universe.                                                |                        |
| Water level and quality monitoring in water resources using IOT   |This project presents a comprehensive solution for monitoring water level and quality in water resources using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system employs Arduino and Node MCU microcontrollers for real-time data collection and transmission. Water level monitoring is accomplished through the integration of float sensors, while Node MCU facilitates the monitoring of various water quality parameters. The project focuses on observing critical water quality indicators to ensure the safety and suitability of water for various purposes. Key objectives of the project include developing a robust monitoring system capable of continuous data collection, analysis, and dissemination. The collected data is processed and made accessible through a dedicated website, providing stakeholders and the public with timely information on water level and quality. This accessibility enables informed decision-making and timely responses to any identified issues or concerns. Methodologically, the project involves the design and implementation of hardware and software components. Arduino and Node MCU are programmed to interface with sensors, collect data, and transmit it to a central server. The server processes the data and updates the website interface, allowing users to access real-time information on water level and quality parameters. Findings from the project demonstrate the effectiveness of the IoT-based monitoring system in providing timely and accurate data on water resources. By making this information readily available to the public, the system promotes awareness and encourages proactive measures to safeguard water quality and ensure sustainable resource management. Overall, the project contributes to enhancing the monitoring and management of water resources through innovative IoT solutions.                                                                                              |                        |
