| **Ezlab**  | In Kerala under KTU many colleges use Etlab as their student management system but its horrible with its UI and unintuitive most often. We built a better interface with student convenience in focus after getting tons of user feedback.                                              | [https://ezlab.vercel.app](https://ezlab.vercel.app/)    | Closed Source Project             |

#### Leadership and Influence:

- Being an Ex-Introvert, Being a leader was always a topic of controversy for me. Once you are a leader, you start to teach things you already know and when new things/tasks come your way you give them to your fellow developers(teammates), That's what a team leader is supposed to do right? Splitting Tasks between the team and managing them. At least for me, this was what I did. And I wasn't a leader at all and I still believe so. I became one among them but didn't play the game for myself even though I was in the ground(big regret).

- Coming to the point of how I will meet the requirements, I will be one among them, walking the talk. Things will be so cool. Standup Meetings(if any) will be fun and you will crave to join my meetings. I will help my peers by providing them access to new knowledge and I will even learn new things to teach them so that we both grow. If you would ask for examples, I have managed the frontend team(2022-23) over here and have come across over 20+ developers and all of them still are in my network. 

#### Networking:

- Being an active member of most of the online/offline communities, I have a network of over 2200+ followers on LinkedIn and nearly half of the same on Instagram as well, unless curious about someone or unless they are within my close circle, I don't send follow requests like hotcakes. Therefore about half of my LinkedIn family are people who connected with me(for some reason idk). Coming forward to my networking skills. I blend in creativity with funny comparisons to craft content and I share them within my network. This content could be informational, product launches, or my achievements and These create a majority of  engagement in my circle.
- 
- Build N Ship, being a developer for myself, I ship so fastt that the people in my domain will be scared of me and they will start learning something just for the sake of keeping up or not getting field out.

#### Career Plan:

- Due to the AI things happening all around, the job market is completely unpredictable now, I could get fired from a job I joined yesterday. So the only way you could achieve stability is by building multiple income streams aka working on/at multiple things. It's like those 3 phase electric wired houses, In case KSEB cuts one off you could easily change the phase and be back online again. "I want to become a React.js Developer working at X company with Y LPA". I don't have any such aims/plans. Just want to work in an environment where I like to work and build things.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- hmm, That is a question beyond my knowledge, and I haven't thought of that yet. I guess maybe hire people who meet certain checkpoints, like achieving or having X karma points. Oh ya, there is one thing if implemented properly can help Kerala excel in the Technology Startup Ecosystem for the future. REMOVE THE 75% ATTENDANCE SYSTEM and PROVIDE INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE TO STUDENTS(not the regular webinar, motivation session. REAL EXP). Glad I had MuLearn when I was in my 2nd year. Hope everyone gets exposure to the same.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Although I haven't really contributed to many open-source repositories, the following would not have existed if I hadn't been working there.
- [MuLearn:](https://github.com/gtech-mulearn/mulearn) `old-production branch` This repository contains the website for the MuLearn Foundation, which I started to build back in 2022 and is an opensource project to which anyone and open a Pull Request. This would be one of my biggest opensource contributions.
- [MuLearn App:](https://github.com/gtech-mulearn/mulearn) `production branch`
- I could type in more than 5 such repositories. But that won't make any sense other than increasing the size of this file. Consider visiting my [Github Profile](https://github.com/AswinAsok), if you are interested in knowing more about me.

#### History of Community Engagement:

- nah, I have nothing significant to say regarding my contributions to such as answering questions on platforms like Stack Overflow or actively participating in technical forums like mailing lists and Discord servers. I have helped a few people on Discord DMs and all but other than that nothing to show.
