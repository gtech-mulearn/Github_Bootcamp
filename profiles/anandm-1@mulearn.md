# Anand M 

### About Me

Myself Anand M., and I am a Computer Science Engineering student at NCERC Thrissur with a strong interest in game development. I am currently honing my programming skills in languages like Python and C/C++, and I have a foundational understanding of web development concepts through ASP.NET. My primary focus, however, lies in the exciting world of game development, where I am actively exploring the capabilities of the Unity engine.

Beyond technical expertise, I believe in maintaining a well-rounded skillset. I am a disciplined individual with a background in the National Cadet Corps (NCC), which has instilled in me strong teamwork and leadership qualities. I am also passionate about volunteering and giving back to the community, always seeking opportunities to connect with new people and develop my interpersonal skills.

In short, I am a highly motivated individual with a clear passion for game development. My technical background, commitment to continuous learning, and strong work ethic make me a valuable asset to any team.
And in my past 3 years and present am a active IEEE member and also 2 years am take position in IEEE SB NCERC Execome

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala, with its educated populace and strong work ethic, is poised to become a leader in India's tech startup ecosystem. To unlock its full potential, the state can focus on several key areas. These include nurturing a talent pool versed in digital technologies, fostering collaboration between academia and industry, and building a robust infrastructure for funding and business support. By prioritizing these aspects, Kerala can cultivate an environment that empowers innovation and attracts talent, propelling it to the forefront of India's tech future.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

-In My Carrier other than College Project i only do 3 ML Projects cause of IEEE ORE Link Program, Its totaly a single person project part of the ORE AI/ML Course 
in My College Project Crime Detection and Survellance System I do collecting The training datas for our project and compleete the entire reports works and Paper publication etc...

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I am active in Linkdin, Discord and Leetcode etc platforms, In linkdin i post and regulerly update my certificates and knowing technical newses and in Discord i am not that much active but use to mainly IEEE xtream to know the newses and Using Leetcode i can learn the coding DSA's etc technical knowledges and training .

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- I post my all of my Technical growths in my linkdin, in there my main growth is the personal project do by part of the IEEE ORE Program.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- VS Code, Unity.

#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- I am Just Active in LeetCode and W3School in leetcode i am just read others programs i am not ready to begin solve a advance questions
