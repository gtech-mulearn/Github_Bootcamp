### About Me

> I am working as a faculty in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Mar Baselios College of Engineering And Technology, Thiruvananthapuram. I am also in charge of Catalyst IEDC and the Technology Business Incubation Centre of MBCET. I am very much interested in building and maintaining networks and am proactively engaged in many social initiatives.  I enjoy taking on new challenging initiatives, especially those that are beneficial for students. I support students in their skill development through various courses designed and developed beyond the curriculum to bridge the gap. I am very much interested in user-centric problem solving and I had multiple funded projects and awards for delivering the same. Throughout my roles as a teacher and mentor, my unwavering commitment has been to inspire and nurture the very best in my students.

#### Leadership and Influence: `required field`

- As a faculty member in the field of electronics, the major area where I consistently demonstrated leadership and influence is Curriculum Enhancement. Leading efforts to revamp and modernize the electronics curriculum to align with emerging technologies and industry trends. For instance, I played a pivotal role in introducing courses on IoT, AI, and embedded systems, ensuring that our students are well-prepared for the industry's future demands. We have also created a lab in collaboration with Intel for working on AI and IoT. 
#### Networking: `required field`

- I enjoy connecting with various communities and actively participate in groups like KSUM IEDC, IETE Gtech MuLearn etc. These communities have greatly contributed to my professional growth. 


#### Career Plan: 
- The startup ecosystem in Kerala is encountering difficulties in attracting skilled technical professionals. I plan to help students improve their technical skills, thereby offering technical support to the ecosystem. I also intend to remain actively involved within the ecosystem.
#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: 

Kerala's Startup ecosystem has flourished and grown immensely after the inception of the Kerala Startup Mission. One major challenge that still exists is the lack of empathy and core technological problem-solving abilities of the co-founders.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Associated with ICFOSS in setting up FOSS cell in the college. Interested in LoRaWAN 
#### History of Community Engagement:

-  Discuss your history of community engagement in a technical capacity, such as answering questions on platforms like Stack Overflow or actively participating in technical forums like mailing lists and Discord servers.
