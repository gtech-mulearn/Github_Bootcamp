### About Me



I am Aswin V, a 4th-year Computer Science student at the College of Engineering Vadakara. With a fervent interest in technology, I am always eager to explore and innovate within the field. Embracing challenges, coding, and staying updated on tech trends are my passions, and I aspire to contribute to the dynamic world of technology with my knowledge and skills.

Since my first year, I have been an active member of IEEE, where I have continuously volunteered and taken on various leadership roles. I have served as a Link Representative and Joint Secretary in our Student Branch, and I contributed as a Design Team member in the IEEE RAS Kerala Chapter during 2020-2021. 

Volunteering and leading teams, as well as conducting programs, are activities I find particularly rewarding. These experiences with IEEE have honed my leadership skills and deepened my interest in making a meaningful impact through technology.
