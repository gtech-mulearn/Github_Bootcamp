| **Saaya 2k23**  | I collaborated with classmates to create the website for our college's arts fest, Saaya 2k23. This dynamic website featured a real-time scoreboard, allowing teachers to effortlessly input scores through a secure administration panel. This ensured up-to-date results and a seamless user experience for all attendees.                                           | [Hosted Link 2](https://saaya23.netlify.app/)    | [Repo Link 2](https://github.com/SabarishAV/Saaya2k23)             |

#### Leadership and Influence:

I'm actively building my experience as a leader and influencer in MERN Stack development. I constantly seek opportunities to showcase these skills and take initiative. For example, in projects like the Saaya 2k23 website, I spearheaded the development process. Collaborating effectively with my classmates, we built a dynamic website featuring a real-time scoreboard. My passion for contributing to the community led me to volunteer at the CAFIT REBOOT'23 job fair.

My leadership extends beyond technical development. I honed my skills further as a core member in conducting ATHMATHON, a state-level hackathon held at AWH Engineering College. This role involved coordinating with various teams, ensuring the smooth operation of the event, and fostering a collaborative environment for participants.

I'm a continuous learner and always looking for ways to influence the developer world. Whether it's through future open-source contributions or knowledge sharing, I'm dedicated to making a positive impact.

#### Networking:

I actively build my network by participating in events like CAFIT REEBOOT'23 and the MuLearn in50hrs program, and by volunteering at the IEDC summit 2023. I engage with online MERN Stack communities, share knowledge, and plan to contribute to open-source projects. By showcasing my expertise, proposing innovative solutions, and fostering collaboration, I aim to become a leader and influencer in the MERN Stack development field.
