### About Me

Hi, I am Anugrah, a computer science student who loves Python programming and web development. I've always been fascinated by technology and how things work, which led me to explore different programming languages. Python quickly became my favorite because it's simple and versatile.
I enjoy working on web development projects, both front-end and back-end. For the front end, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive and interactive user interfaces. On the back end, I use Python framework Flask to build strong and scalable applications. I often integrate various APIs to ensure smooth data handling.I'm also a tech enthusiast who likes to stay updated with the latest trends and advancements.
