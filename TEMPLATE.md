| **Evolving Rail Networks Using Evolutionary Genetic Algorithm(AI)**  |  Developed a comprehensive system comprising 3 modules (A) Train Delay Prediction: To analyze historical train data to gain insights into factors influencing train delays and to build a predictive model capable of estimating the likelihood of a train being delayed with the help of random forest regression algorithm. (B) Self-Driving Train Simulation:  Implemented NEAT to train artificial neural networks (ANNs) to control the train's behavior and navigate its environment by considering factors like obstacles and reaching destinations efficiently, thereby making the train run efficiently with minimum delay. (C) Train Timetable Optimization:  is a system to optimize train timetables within the Indian railway network using genetic algorithms.                                              | [Hosted Link 1](https://example.com)    | [Repo Link 1](https://github.com/username/project1)             |
